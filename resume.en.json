    "summary": "Father of two, living in the countryside, I have built a strong personal and professional balance that helps me handle pressure and the fast-paced nature of the tech industry with calm and clarity.\n\nPassionate about technology from an early age, I built my career around software development before moving into Tech Lead roles. This experience led me to work across application architecture, software quality and infrastructure, and gradually develop a strong interest in DevOps.\n\nToday, I work with a holistic product mindset, combining development, DevOps and automation, in a context where AI accelerates delivery cycles. I position myself as a product builder, at the intersection of development, DevOps and product.",
